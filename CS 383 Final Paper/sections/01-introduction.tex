The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies strokes as the second leading cause of death globally \cite{WHO}. A stroke happens when a person's blood supply to their brain is interrupted or reduced, causing brain cells to die within minutes. It prevents the brain tissue from getting the oxygen and nutrients that it needs and is responsible for approximately 11\% of total deaths. To see what effect certain factors had on people who suffered strokes, we decided to create 3 Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. We did this by not only writing our own code to create the models, but we also compared the yielded metrics to those from built-in models of \verb|Scikit-Learn|, a built-in Machine Learning Python library.
